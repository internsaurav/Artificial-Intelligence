SAT Solver programming in Proposition Logic<br />
-Learned how to encode Satisfability problems using propositional logic. Implemented the DPLL
algorithm to solve the SAT problem using Python.<br />
-Implemented the Propositional-Logic-Resolution algorithm to draw inference about satisfability of
the problem statement.<br />
